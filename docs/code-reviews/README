Code Review
===========
File: gst/gstbin.c
Revision: 1.41
Date: Dec 16, 2000
Reviewer: Erik Walthinsen <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

Line 20:
#define GST_DEBUG_ENABLED

Shouldn't be here, DEBUG should be enabled globally.  May leave until
scheduling changes are done.

Line 117: (gst_bin_class_init)
  gstelement_class->elementfactory =    gst_elementfactory_find("bin");

Not sure this is such a great idea.  I thought the GstElement code did this
kind of stuff?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The format will evolve as we do more stuff, such as putting in fields for 
recommended actions, comments regarding any later changes made and when, etc.
